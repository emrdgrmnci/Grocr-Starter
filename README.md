# Grocr-Starter

  This project about binary search tree, hash tables and heap data structure. I make this project for my class. 
    First of all, i did just user authentication which is show signed up and online users to my app. If you don't registered to app 
  you do not see your grocery items. My registered users shopping moves are listing in my Firebase account. I have done of search of user
  by their names and shopping items.
    So, data structures are so fun !
